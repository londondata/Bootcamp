<h1>Welcome to Day 2, {{character.name}}</h1>

<p>You get up and go to class, but notice that you feel more tired and a bit irritated. However, you still have energy and feel cheerful. </p>

<p>
	Professor Blueslime covers more information about Python syntax and data types. You work on implementing FizzBuzz in Python and work on a basic trivia game that runs in the Python REPL in the terminal. It's fun, but you feel a little slower when it comes to learning new stuff today.
</p>

<p>
	You have a feeling you will become a little more tired and crabby every day as BOOTCAMP progresses.
