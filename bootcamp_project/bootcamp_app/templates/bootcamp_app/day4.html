    {% if stayed in %}

    Your studying pays off with your coding knowledge, but you fall into a deep depression over missing your best friend and suffer a permanent drop in your mood.

=======
    <p>
			Your studying pays off by improving your coding knowledge by a lot. You whiz through setting up your first Django project and application, and you even help your classmates set up their projects! Wait, was Professor Blueslime smiling at you?!
		</p>
		<p>
			However, despite your successes in class today, you fall into a deep depression because you missed saying goodbye to your best friend. You know that they are super mad at you, and that sucks. You suffer a permanent drop in your mood.
