<h1>Welcome to Day 8, {{character.name}}</h1>

<p>You get up and go to class. Two more days (including this one) and a final exam, and you're done. </p>

<p>
	Today's lesson involves the Django Rest Framework. Professor Blueslime demonstrates how to build a Django-based API, and how to use the API interface to CREATE, GET, and UPDATE data. It's a pretty long lecture and lab, and it takes the entire day.
</p>

<p>
  You can't believe BOOTCAMP is almost over. Will you pass?
</p>
